# Cocktails-with-Kanye

## Description

As a user i want to be able to search for differnt cocktails and be entertained by Kanye quotes
I WANT to have a list of drinks available to me based on my liquor preference or at random
SO THAT I can view a picture of the drink as well as a random quote
GIVEN I do not have the recipe for the cocktail
WHEN I select a drink
THEN It will give me the drink ingredients and instructions to make the drink
WHEN I want to have a drink at random I can click a button and have one appear
THEN The drink that is selected will be saved in history for me to view later
WHEN I navigate to the dropdown
THEN a selection of liquor will show and allow user to click on a specfic liquor
WHEN I click next page or previous page on the liquor selection provided
THEN it will cycle through the array of drinks available
WHEN I click on the title logo
THEN it will reset the page allowing me to order a new drink either way


NOTES:

Working on:
1) Increasing liquor selection to compelete liquor array (and not just 18)
2) Fixing previous and next buttons in drink history
3) Fixing big that only saves history from random drink function and not liquor select function
4) Making the drink cards dynamic (and not empty placeholders)
5) Making history of drink cards open up the drink info (ingredients/instructions)

## Collaborators

James was the powerhouse of the operation, correlating with other team members, instructors, tutors, etc. James wrote much of the Javascript and HTML to get it functional.
Inna rivalled Kanye’s stylistic mind and got the page oriented the way it is and made a pleasing to the eye application that made it so then alcohol isn’t the only good thing about it.
Julian was commandeering group sessions and making sure everyone knew what to do, and was helping James and Inna in areas that they may of been stuck on. Two minds are better than one.
Nathan was a co-pilot, holding zoom meetings on some off days to help everyone have smooth flying. Helping the others with issues they had, Nathan was a jack-of-all-trades.
